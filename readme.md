## Contracts for the Radiate Protocol

To install Foundry, the tool used to develop these contracts, please follow this (guide)[https://book.getfoundry.sh/].


Radiate Protocol is focused on allowing for 4626 tokenzied looping strategies for Radiant, the cross chain money market on Arbitrum (and BSC). By allowing for single sided staking, this is not only more efficient to manage, but this is also easier to run.


We're allowing for single sided staking of DLP tokens in exchange for a WETH denominated cut of the looping yield.

If stakers want to receive boosted yield, they can deposit into the Staking Chef, where their stakes will be vested into PoL, and they'll earn yields denominated in RDT tokens.
